# Programming Bitcoin: Ruby

This repository is based off of the book _Programming Bitcoin_ by Jimmy Song. The repo that is used throughout the book uses Python and includes answers to exercises, tests, and answers to the ultimate project (a bitcoin client) as it is incrementally developed chapter by chapter.

This repository is intended to be a collection of tests and the Ruby implementation of the project as it is developed through each chapter. It does not include exercise solutions (except for those which directly affect the project).
